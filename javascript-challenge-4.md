# Code Challenge
Complete the following problems using JavaScript in the order of your choice. Work alone using any resources available to you (but don't look up code solutions!).

## Challenge 1: Palindrome 
Using JavaScript, write a function to return the string "true" if str, where str is a string, is a palindrome.
#### Example 1: str = "racecar"
##### Expected result: "true"
#### Example 2: str = "chipmunk"
##### Expected result: "false"


## Challenge 4: Second Best and Worst
Using JavaScript, take the array of numbers stored in arr, where arr is an array, and return the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively, separated by a space.
##### Example: arr = [17, 7, 12, 98, 106]
##### Expected result: 12 98


## Challenge 3: Bubble Sort
Using JavaScript, write a bubbleSort function to sort arr, where arr is an array of integers. [Wikipedia - Bubblesort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
##### Example: arr = [98, 734, 7, 3, 5, 29, 10, 87, 33, 54, 72, 461]
#### Expected Result: [3, 5, 7, 10, 29, 33, 54, 72, 87, 98, 461, 734]


## Challenge 4: Find the Numbers (Hint: use ReGex)
Using JavaScript, take str, where str is a string, and search for all the numbers in the string
* add them together, print the sum
* print that sum of numbers divided by the total number of letters in the string (rounded to the nearest whole number).
##### Example: str = "H3llo6 9World!"
#### Expected Sum of numbers: 3+6+9 = 18
#### Expected Sum of numbers divided by number of letters: 18 / 0 = 2


## Challenge: Fibonacci
Using JavaScript, write a Fibonacci function, either recursive or iterative, that takes int, where int is an integer, representing the index of a number in the Fibonacci sequence and outputs the Fibonacci number of that index. [Wikipedia - Fibonacci Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
##### Example: int = 10
#### Expected Result: 55
