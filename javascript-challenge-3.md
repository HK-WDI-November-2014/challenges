# Code Challenge
Complete the following problems using JavaScript in the order of your choice. Work alone using any resources available to you (but don't look up code solutions!).

## Challenge 1: Palindrome 
Using JavaScript, write a function to return the string "true" if str, where str is a string, is a palindrome.
#### Example 1: str = "racecar"
##### Expected result: "true"
#### Example 2: str = "chipmunk"
##### Expected result: "false"


## Challenge 2: countClumps
Create a countClumps(array) function:  Returns the number of times 2 or more of the same number appear sequentially.
##### Example: 
###### [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1] => 2
###### [9, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7] => 3
