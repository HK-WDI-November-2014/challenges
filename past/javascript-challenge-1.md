# Code Challenge
Complete the following problems using JavaScript in the order of your choice. Work alone using any resources available to you (but don't look up code solutions!).

## Challenge 1: Display elements in array 
Using JavaScript, create a function that prints in the console all the numbers from 1 to num, where num is a number. Run this function for num = 10.
##### Example: for num = 4, expected result is:
#### 1
#### 2
#### 3
#### 4

## Challenge 2: Simple Add 
Using JavaScript, create a function that adds up all the numbers from 1 to num, where num is a number. Print the result of the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 in the console.
##### Example: for num = 4, expected result is:
#### 10

## Challenge 3: Christmas Tree
Using JavaScript, write a christmasTree function that creates a tree with the number of levels in the tree equal to int, where in is an integer.
##### Example: for int = 5, expected result is:
#### *
#### **
#### ***
#### ****
#### *****

## Challenge 4: Play with array
Using JavaScript, write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument, and returns an array where each element has been multiplied by 2. Print the result for [1,3,8,46,3,0,-10]
##### Example: for arr = [5, 8, 2], expected result is:
#### [10, 16, 4]


## Challenge 5: Play with array (2)
Using JavaScript, write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument, and returns the sum of all the elements. Print the result for [1,3,8,46,3,0,-10]
##### Example: for arr = [5, 8, 2], expected result is:
#### 15

## Challenge 6: Concatenate strings
Using JavaScript, create a function that takes 2 arguments (name and age), and prints in the console a string that says "my name is ..., I am ... years old". Run this function with your name and age.
##### Example: for Bob and 50, expected result is:
#### My name is Bob, I am 50 years old.

## Challenge 7: Concatenate strings + if statement
Using JavaScript, create a function that takes 1 argument (numOfApples), and prints in the console a string that says "I have ... apples" (plural) or "I have ... apple" (singular) depending on the number. Run this function with 1 and 5.

## Challenge 8: Concatenate strings + if statement (2)
Using JavaScript, create a function that takes 1 argument (numOfApples), and prints in the console a string that says "I have ... apples" (plural) or "I have ... apple" or "I don't have any apples" depending on the number. Run this function with 0, 1 and 5.

## Challenge 9: if statement (3)
Using JavaScript, create a function that takes 1 argument (num) which is a number, and prints in the console:
* "negative" if num is below 0
* "nill" if num is equal to 0
* "positive" if num is above 0
Run this function with 100, 0 and -5.

## Challenge 10: power
Using JavaScript, create a function that takes 2 argument (num and exponent) which are positive integers, and prints in the console the result of num^exponent (num power exponent). Print the result of 2^10
##### Example: for num = 2 and exponent = 3, expected result is:
#### 8 (2x2x2)
